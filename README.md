● Create a service with get method using any public API, you can call API from APIs link or any other  
● Create a method in your component to call that service using observable.  
● Again create a method in your component to call that service using promise.

<u>Notes:
1. I've used angular-cli for this project and so it will run with command:
`ng serve` on localhost:4200
2. * Service is in user.service
    * data to be rendered is obtained from a json placeholder
    * component is in app.component
    * view rendered in app.component.html
